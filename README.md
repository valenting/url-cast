This tool uses the [nodecastor library](https://github.com/vincentbernat/nodecastor) and the [URL cast receiver](https://github.com/demille/url-cast-receiver) to provide a simple to use script that makes your chromecast load a webpage.
Just pass it the chromecast's IP and a URL.

`node cast.js <IP> <URL>`

Remember to run `npm install` to download the dependencies.
